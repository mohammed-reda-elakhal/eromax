# Static Media Folder

This folder is for static media files that will be used by the service worker for offline functionality.

## Required Files

Please add the following files to this directory:

1. `offline-image.jpg` - An image to be displayed on the offline page
   - Replace the placeholder .txt file with an actual JPG image
   - Recommended size: 600px wide
   - Should be optimized for web (compressed)

## Additional Media

You can add additional media files here that you want to be available offline, such as:

- Logo variations
- Default avatar images
- Loading animations
- Error state illustrations

## Best Practices

- Keep file sizes small to minimize cache usage
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize all images for web
- Consider using WebP format for better compression
