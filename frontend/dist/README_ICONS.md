# Icon Files for PWA

For the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality to work properly, please add the following icon files to this directory:

1. `logo192.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon for your app
2. `logo512.png` - A 512x512 pixel PNG icon for your app
3. Create an `icons` folder and add:
   - `track.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon for the track shortcut
   - `login.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon for the login shortcut

4. Create a `screenshots` folder and add:
   - `home-screen.png` - A screenshot of your home page (1280x720 recommended)
   - `dashboard.png` - A screenshot of your dashboard (1280x720 recommended)

These icons will be used by browsers and mobile devices when users add your app to their home screen.

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent design language across all icons
- Make sure icons are recognizable at small sizes
- Use a transparent background for the PNG files
- For the main app icons, use a square design with slightly rounded corners
- The main color should match your brand color (#002242 blue)

You can use tools like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or online services like Canva to create these icons.
